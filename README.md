Student's task "Redux"

Step 1

The Contact Book app used Redux library functions (no redux-toolkit).

The developer tools have been added.

Actions (actions) have been created to save and delete a contact, as well as to update the filter (#contacts-actions.js).

Action types are created in a separate persistent file (#contacts-types.js).

Created contact and filter reducers (#contacts-reducer.js).

React components are tied to Redux logic when using the react-redux library (connect).

Step 2

Code refactoring was carried out using the Redux Tookit library. The functions used were 
- configureStore (), 
- createAction (), 
- createReducer ().
